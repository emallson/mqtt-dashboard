# mqtt-dashboard

This is a small web application to display information from a
WebSocket-enabled MQTT broker (Mosquitto is used in development).

## Scope

This application is just for a project in a course, and will not be
maintained past the end of the Fall 2016 semester. Feel free to fork
and extend.
